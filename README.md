Automated Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning
1. Background
Brain tumors represent abnormal masses or growths of cells within the brain's confined cranial space and pose significant medical challenges. These tumors can be either benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous), each with unique complexities in treatment and prognosis. Early and accurate detection is essential due to the potential severity of brain tumors and the precision required for effective treatment.

2. Overview of Previous Research
Recent studies in the domain of medical imaging and AI have focused on enhancing the precision of brain tumor diagnosis. Notably:

Ying, Z., Holly N., et al. (2020) explored automated glioma grading using Mask R-CNN with 2D data augmentation on conventional MRI images.
Rajat M. et al. (2020) utilized Transfer Learning with five pre-trained deep learning models for AI-based brain tumor classification.
3. Project Overview
This project aims to leverage cutting-edge artificial intelligence models to classify and detect brain tumors effectively. The key technologies employed are:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Particularly suited for analyzing image data, CNNs have demonstrated effectiveness in identifying patterns and features indicative of tumors.
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): Capable of modeling complex data relationships, ANNs are widely used across various healthcare applications.
Data Augmentation: Enhances the size and quality of training datasets to improve model robustness and generalizability.
Transfer Learning (TL) with ResNet: Utilizes pre-trained models to achieve high performance, even on smaller, specialized datasets like those in medical imaging.
4. Purpose
The integration of these deep learning technologies aims to automate the detection and classification of brain tumors, enhancing diagnostic processes and enabling faster, more accurate tumor identification. This could significantly improve treatment strategies and patient survival rates.

5 Dataset
Two brain MRI datasets are utilized in this project:

Brain Tumor MRI Dataset from Kaggle: Contains 7,023 images divided into glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary categories. The dataset is balanced with approximately 1,500 training images and 300 testing images per category.
Br35H:: Brain Tumor Detection 2020 from Kaggle: Includes 3,060 images categorized into yes (with tumors), no (without tumors), and pred (for predictions). This dataset is clearly divided between training and testing sets, facilitating effective model training and evaluation.
